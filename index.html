        <p>You may type in names of shapes you would like to draw once you click the "DRAW SHAPE" button. Then you may type in a color you would like the shape to be.</p>
        <p>If you would rather draw your own shapes you may do so by moving your mouse and clicking to put a point on the screen. To complete a shape you must hover near your first point and click to lock in the shape. If you are in the middle of drawing a shape and wish to erase it, press the spacebar.</p>
